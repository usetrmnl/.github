# Clarity, at a glance

TRMNL is a platform that connects with popular products on the web, then renders their most useful information on an e-ink display. We believe this black & white, focused, hands-off approach is the best way to stay informed without getting distracted.

Our proprietary device is available for purchase at [https://usetrmnl.com](https://usetrmnl.com), however we also provide guides to build your own device, install and mod our open source firmware, and even point your own device (or ours) at your own web server for end-to-end privacy.

See the other repositories in this GitHub organization and our API docs (https://docs.usetrmnl.com) to get started.
