# Clarity, at a glance

TRMNL is a platform that renders useful information from popular products on e-ink displays.

Our proprietary device is available for purchase at [https://usetrmnl.com](https://usetrmnl.com), however we also provide guides to build your own device, leverage our open source firmware, and even point your own device (or ours) at your own web server for end to end privacy.

See the other repositories in this GitHub organization and our API docs (https://docs.usetrmnl.com) to get started.
